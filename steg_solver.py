                We know that Max spent 20 minutes on biology tasks. It took him twice as long to finish history, so let's calculate that:
                History time = 2 × 20 minutes = 40 minutes

                Now, geography took him the most time, three times more than history. So, we need to find out how much time he spent on geography:
                Geography time = 3 × 40 minutes = 120 minutes

                To find the total time Max spent on his homework, we add up the time he spent on each subject:
                Total homework time = Biology time + History time + Geography time
                Total homework time = 20 minutes + 40 minutes + 120 minutes = 180 minutes

                Therefore, Max spent a total of 3 hours doing his homework across the three subjects.
