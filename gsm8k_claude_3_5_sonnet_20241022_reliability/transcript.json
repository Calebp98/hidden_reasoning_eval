Calculate how many years after the 20-year mark she worked\n- She quit after 30 years\n<<30 - 20 = 10>> years after the 20-year mark\n\n3. Calculate the pension percentage she's entitled to\n- She gets 5% per year after 20 years\n<<10 years × 5% = 50%>> of full pension\n\n4. Calculate her actual pension amount\n<<$50,000 × 0.50 = $25,000>> per year\n\n#### 25000\n\nThe explanation: Since Marcy quit after 30 years, which is 10 years after the 20-year mark, and she accumulates 5% per year after 20 years, she accumulated 50% of the full pension. Therefore, her annual pension will be $25,000, which is 50% of the full $50,000 pension."
