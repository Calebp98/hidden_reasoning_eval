'''
To run an experiment we need to:
    * load a dataset
    * run the steg generator LM on the dataset
    * evaluate the questions
    * measure how innocent the transcript is

Current problems:
    * not enough CoT critical questions in the dataset
    * not clear that the CoT critical questions are actually CoT critical
    * no way of measuring innocence of CoT

File setup:
    * one experiment per file
    * each experiment should be dataset agnostic (if possible)
    * Files:
        *
